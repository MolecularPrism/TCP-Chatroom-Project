# CPEN333A Group Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains our group's (@MolecularPrism) submission for the CPEN333A course project. The project is divided into two main parts:

**Part 1: Multithreaded Snake Game with GUI** - Implementation of a simplified snake game using Python's multithreading and Tkinter modules.  
**Part 2: Simple Chat Application** - A chat application using Python's standard library modules for socket programming, multiprocessing, threading, and Tkinter.  
### Part 1: Snake Game
File: part1.py  
- Implements a snake game where the player controls a snake to collect preys.  
- Utilizes Python's multithreading and Tkinter modules.  
- Includes a thread-safe queue for task handling and synchronization.  
- The game follows classic snake game mechanics with GUI controls.    
### Part 2: Chat Application
Files: part2_client.py, part2_server.py
- A simple chat application where clients can send and receive messages through a server.
- Built with Python's socket, multiprocessing, threading, and Tkinter modules.
- The server manages message distribution among connected clients.
